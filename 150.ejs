    <h4>
      FRIENDS OF FCPS REACTS TO FAIRFAX COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS’ ADVERTISED TAX RATE
    </h4>

    <p><em><b>Concerned citizens to gather at a Town Hall Meeting with Supervisor Dan Storck and Sharon Bulova</b></em></p>

    <p>
      by Friends of FCPS
    </p>

    <p>
      Friends of FCPS is disappointed with the decision by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors to set an Advertised Tax Rate of $1.13, which is 4 cents above the current residential property tax rate of $1.09 (per $100 of assessed value). To provide full funding for Fairfax County Public Schools, it is estimated the Board of Supervisors would have to advertise a tax rate increase of at least 6 cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since January 7, thousands of Fairfax County residents have spoken out for fully funding the School Board's FY 2017 budget request. Parents, students, and community members were seeking to continue their dialogue with the Board of Supervisors during the April 5-7 budget hearings. By foreclosing the possibility of full funding for FCPS, the Board of Supervisors is depriving the community of the opportunity to advocate for the appropriate tax rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friends of FCPS thanks the Supervisors who supported a higher Advertised Tax Rate to enable a continuation of the community dialogue. Although the decision today represents a setback, Friends of FCPS will continue to advocate to sustain the quality of our public schools, preserve our property values, and strengthen the local economy.
