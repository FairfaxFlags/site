    <strong><em><span style="font-size: 180%;">Expansion of World Language Programs Proposed</span></em></strong><br />
    <strong><em><span style="font-size: 130%;">What You Can Do Now to Show Your Support &amp; Influence Decisions</span></em></strong><br />
    <br />
    The expansion of elementary World Language programs in Fairfax County Public Schools may be a possibility according to the recently-released <a href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2013.shtml">FY 2013 proposed school budget</a> by Superintendent Jack Dale.<br />
    <br />
    It’s exciting that expansion of elementary World Language programs may be back on track, but note that the final approved budget involves a process and <strong>expansion is contingent </strong>on funding and prioritization of the current School Board, which is composed of six newly-elected board members. If expansion does not remain in the advertised budget adopted Feb. 9, it is highly unlikely that it will be added back into the FY 2013 budget at a later date.<br />
    <strong><u><br /></u></strong>
    <strong><u>What You Can Do</u>:</strong><br />
    <br />
    With so many new board members, it’s key they hear from the community--that will impact their direction and priorities. If you want to help expand our elementary language programs and/or provide feedback on the many other areas of the budget, here’s what you can do and when:<br />
    <strong><br /></strong>
    <strong>● Jan. 30 (and Jan. 31 if needed):</strong> Speak at the FCPS budget public hearings. Student speakers make a great impact at hearings, so don’t forget to see if your student would like to speak! Visit the <a href="http://www.fcps.edu/schlbd/meetings/requestspeak.shtml">School Board’s website </a>to sign up, and please email us to let us know. Sign up deadline is 4:30 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 27.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>● Before Feb. 9:</strong> Write to the School Board to provide your feedback before they vote. Email <a href="mailto:SchoolBoardMembers@fcps.edu">SchoolBoardMembers@fcps.edu</a> and copy <a href="mailto:JDDale@fcps.edu">JDDale@fcps.edu</a>. Be sure to include your school or address. If you are writing in support of elementary foreign language expansion, please copy <a href="mailto:fairfaxflags@gmail.com">fairfaxflags@gmail.com</a> for our tracking purposes.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>● Now and anytime: </strong>Invite School Board members to visit your school’s immersion or FLES programs to see them in action and learn their value.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>● Ongoing:</strong> Stay informed and learn more about the budget. See informative links below.<br />
    Two years ago, over 100 speakers spoke in support of immersion and FLES--and that was key to saving our existing programs. It would be great for our group to help bring these programs to other FCPS elementary students.<br />
    <br />
    <strong><u>FY 2013 Budget Highlights</u>:</strong><br />
    <u><strong><br /></strong></u>
    The proposed budget requests a $202 million, or 9 percent, increase from last year and includes:<br />
    <br />
    ● Expansion of FLES or Foreign Language in the Elementary Schools to eight new schools (proposed to be fully implemented in all grade levels) and expansion of foreign language partial immersion to two new schools ($0.9M) No decisions yet on specific school implementations or languages.<br />
    <br />
    ● Re-introduction of summer school ($5M)<br />
    <br />
    ● A staffing reserve to address large class sizes ($2M)<br />
    <br />
    ● Increase in employee compensation (see below links for details on $ and many more budget items)<br />
    <br />
    Thanks again for your continued support of our programs and our schools. Please <a href="mailto:fairfaxflags@gmail.com">contact us</a> if you have any questions or thoughts for moving forward through this FY 2013 budget cycle.<br />
