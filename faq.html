                          <b>Yes. Without a major outpouring of support - now - it most likely will.</b> Here is what you need to know:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          In 2009, Fairfax FLAGS and its allies succeeded in saving Fairfax County Public Schools’ (FCPS) World Language Immersion and FLES (now LTC) programs from being eliminated. 
                          After this win, the organization became dormant. <b>The battle had been won…or so everyone thought.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Enter 7 more years of budget cuts. Due to a number of factors, including tougher economic times, FCPS has been forced to cut its budget every year since 2008.
                          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2017/faq.shtml">Nearly a half-billion dollars has been cut from the schools’ budget since 2008</a>—which means that FCPS is spending $1,000
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/matthew.dunne.562/videos/577463849073113"> less</a> on each student today than it did in 2009.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Faced with another year of budget cuts, FCPS enlisted help from the community. It set up a Budget Task Force to make recommendations on what the schools could cut next.
                          The Task Force solicited help from the wider community, asking the public to use an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2017/budget-tool.shtml">online budget tool</a> to make their own recommendations for cuts.
                          In November 2015, the Task Force made its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2017/taskforce/index.shtml">recommendations</a>. <b>Over 75% of the Task Force members chose to cut Language Immersion</b> 
                          if FCPS is required to reduce its budget by $50 million.
                          The <a target="_blank" href="faq.html#ltc">LTC</a> program seems safe from cuts at the moment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          After the Budget Task Force recommendations were published, Fairfax FLAGS mobilized once again.
                          Parents and students wrote emails to Superintendent Garza, urging her to save Language Immersion. Other elected officials were also contacted,
                          with a view of both explaining the importance of early language acquisition and the urgency of fully funding our schools.
                          On January 9, new Fairfax FLAGS leader Matthew Dunne and FLAGS treasurer Amy Fujii <b>spoke in defense of our world language programs</b> at the Virginia state delegate assembly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          On January 7, Superintendent Garza released her proposed budget. Instead of making more budget cuts, she presented a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2017.shtml">budget with no cuts</a>—and in fact,
                          a modest increase, to be used primarily for increasing employee salaries and reducing elementary class size.
                          In this proposed budget, the Language Immersion program remains in place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But <b>the fight has just begun</b>. Fully funding Superintendent Garza’s budget will take convincing the School Board to approve it and—even more challenging—convincing the
                          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/government/board">Fairfax County Board of Supervisors</a> to raise its funding to FCPS.
                          Simultaneously, advocates must lobby the state government to allow more of Fairfax County’s state taxes to remain here, to fund our schools.
                          Only 23% of funding for FCPS comes from the state, a significantly lower percentage than that of other Virginia school districts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The School Board has requested a 6.7 percent increase in the FCPS budget. (Fairfax County provides 70% of the FCPS budget.)
                          Despite pleas from parents, students, teachers, and many advocacy groups, including Fairfax FLAGS, on March 1,
                          the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors (BOS) voted an advertised tax rate that potentially underfunds Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) by $68 million.
                          In a 5-5 vote, the BOS voted to increase property taxes by 4 cents after rejecting 5 and 6 cent increases that would given them more flexibility in school funding. 
                          <b>
                          This is the worst-case scenario anticipated by the School Board: if the currently planned transfer level is not
                          increased, and the county follows the the budget task force's recommendations, all langauge immersion programs will be elliminated this fall.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <b>Fairfax FLAGS is partnering with other advocacy groups</b> to support the fight to fully fund FCPS. If we lose this fight, <b>Language Immersion could be the first academic program on the chopping block</b>.

                                    Fairfax County Public Schools offers two types of partial immersion programs in elementary schools. Under the partial immersion model, students spend half of the day learning in a world language and the other half in English.

                                <p>
                                    First, the World Languages Immersion Program enables students at eight elementary schools to learn a world language (French, German, Japanese, or Spanish) beginning in first grade. Most students participating in this program type are learners (and not native speakers) of the world language. Students learn math, science, and health through the medium of a world language. The curriculum follows the FCPS Program of Studies.

                                    Second, the Two-Way Immersion Program enables students at nine elementary schools to learn a world language (Spanish or Korean) beginning in kindergarten. Approximately half of the students participating in this program type are native speakers of the world language. The program focuses on the development of literacy and content area skills in English and the world language. The students who are native speakers of English learn literacy skills in English and the world language. Through this exposure, they acquire the Spanish or Korean language.  Students who are native speakers of the world language develop English language skills while also developing literacy and content area skills in their home language. The program mutually benefits both student populations as they can serve as peer language role models for each other. The curriculum follows the FCPS Program of Studies.

                                    Fairfax County Public Schools provide a middle school immersion transition program at feeder middle schools for students who successfully complete a FCPS elementary language immersion program.  Specifically, students who begin learning a second language in elementary school may continue their language study in middle and high school. Students successfully completing the 7th Grade Immersion 1 course earn a high school credit. The same is true for students who successfully complete the 8th Grade Immersion 2 course. Immersion students enter high school in 9th Grade at Level 3 of the world language.

                                    The Language through Content (LTC) program replaces the successful Foreign Language in the Elementary School (FLES) program in Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS). There are 54 FCPS schools with LTC programs. Of the 56 schools, 36 schools offer Spanish LTC programs. The remaining schools offer Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Japanese LTC programs.

                                    The LTC program is an approach to language learning that allows students to develop basic communicative skills in a language while reinforcing and enriching concepts from the general program of studies. The LTC program places an emphasis on Science concepts and includes Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) skills. STEAM is based on student driven inquiry and problem solving investigations. Combining such skills with language learning provides a unique way for students to acquire the target foreign language while preparing them with the 21st Century skills needed to become successful global citizens.
                                    FCPS students who participate in an LTC program have the opportunity to continue learning the target foreign language at the middle school and high school levels.

                                    The successful Foreign Language in the Elementary School (FLES) program in Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) was recently replaced with the Language through Content (LTC) program. The FLES program was an approach to language learning that allowed students to develop basic communicative skills in a language while reinforcing and enriching content in other disciplines.

                                <p>
                                    The FLES model provided all students in an elementary school with language learning opportunities. Research studies have indicated that the early study of a second language results in cognitive benefits, gains in academic achievement, and increases in self-esteem, creativity, and positive attitudes toward diversity.

                                <p>
                                    The FCPS FLES model developed students' language proficiency by providing language instruction that supported the concepts taught in the subject areas at the respective grade level. Generally, FLES programs provided 30 minutes of instruction 2-3 times per week, which was continued through middle and high school. The FCPS FLES model was based on the research that shows that students are not only able to learn but are also highly engaged in learning content through the target language. In addition, the culture of the target language was integrated into instruction.

                                    <li>FLES instruction was proficiency-oriented. This means that there was a greater focus on meaningful and purposeful communication than on grammatical mastery. Students were encouraged first to understand and then to produce in the language. The target language was used by both teachers and students.</li>
                                    <li>The FLES program was based on four thematic units at each grade level. The themes were aligned with the FCPS Foreign Language Program of Studies for Grades 7-12 and mirror the spiraling progression of the other content areas. The FLES program was also aligned with the National Foreign Language Standards.</li>
