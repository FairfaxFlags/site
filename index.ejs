      <h4>
        Scenes from the March 1 Budget Hearing
      </h4>

      <h1>
        <b>Japan bashing is so 1995 - or so we thought</b>
      </h1>
      <b>Supervisor John Cook claims he's ready to fund teacher pay (lying? watch him look down after he says it, and be the judge) and then trashes the successful, 10 year old Japanese immersion program because it serves "a small elite." (and why not French or German while he's at it? - hmm). 
      The Japanese immersion program costs less than 1 million a year.  
      Later, he votes against 46 million and 23 million dollar measures to fund the schools.</b>
      <b>
        <i>See what he's doing there? Fairfax citizens are not idiots, and this kind of demagoguery has no place in our county.</i>

        <b>Mocking Constituents</b>
      </h1>
      <b>Seeming vaguely amused and a bit annoyed by constituents who have expressed to her the value of programs like language (Japanese - again? What's up with that?), music, and art, 
      Supervisor Linda Q. Smith wonders aloud why her constituents aren't more concerned with less frivoulus things, like "science." Does she think her they are fools? Why don't they care about things that really matter?
      Later, she voted to effectively cut the school budget across the board - so much for science, other core subjects and art, language, and science programs.</b>
      <b>
        <i>Improbably, her attack on our school system is even more far-reaching, simple-minded, contemptous of parents, and neglectfull of students than Cook's. These are the kind of leaders we have?</i>
