      <h1><b>A new low in Fairfax county politics</b></h1>
      <h4>
        Scenes from the March 1 Budget Hearing
      </h4>

      <h1>
        <b>Japan bashing is so 1995 - or so we thought</b>
      </h1>
      <b>Supervisor John Cook claims he's ready to fund teacher pay (Lying? Watch him look down after he says it, and be the judge. Spoiler alert: he is) and then trashes the successful, 10 year old Japanese immersion program because it serves "a small elite." (and why not French or German while he's at it? - hmm). 
      The Japanese immersion program costs less than 1 million a year.  
      Later, he votes down a 46 million dollar measure, and then a 23 million dollar measures, to fund our schools.</b>
      <b>
        <i>See what he's doing there? Devalue - without any argument - a program that is insignificant in the overall scheme of the budget, as cover for devastating cuts to the education system as a whole.
        Fairfax citizens see though it, and this kind of demagoguery has no place in our county. (What an incredible [reprehensible individual]! - his voters may love this kind of rhetoric, but if Fiarfax Flags can't punish him for saying things like that, we aren't doing our job.)</i>
        (We should make arguments for the value of tailored programs (immersion, etc) elswhere on the site - that's easy. His "elite" is hugely attackable)

        <b>Mocking Constituents</b>
      </h1>
      <b>Seeming vaguely amused and a bit annoyed by constituents who have expressed to her the value of programs like language (Japanese - again? What's up with that?), music, and art, 
      Supervisor Linda Q. Smith wonders aloud why her constituents aren't more concerned with less frivoulus things, like "science." Does she think they are fools? Why don't they care about things that really matter?
      Later, she voted to effectively cut the school budget across the board - so much for science, other core subjects and art, language, and science programs.</b>
      <b>
        <i>Improbably, her attack on our school system is even more far-reaching, simple-minded, contemptous of parents, and neglectfull of students than Cook's. Thankfully, we have some admirable county supervisors who do not think this way.</i>
