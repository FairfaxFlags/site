	Elected officials are making funding decisions right now. We need you to show your support for full funding for FCPS and the preservation of our world language programs!

<p>
<b>FLAGS Action Meeting:</b> Please join us for an open meeting on Thursday, Feb. 11, at 6:30 PM to learn more about the FCPS budget crisis and what you can do to save our schools and world language programs.
</p>
<p>
All FCPS schools, parents, and community members are invited to participate. The meeting will be held at Orange Hunt Elementary School - Cafeteria, 6820 Sydenstricker Rd, Springfield.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<b>Invest in Kids Rally:</b> Please join us to advocate for full funding for our schools during an indoor rally on Tuesday, Feb. 16, from 4:45-5:45 pm at the indoor amphitheater of the Fairfax County Government Center (12000 Government Center Pkwy, Fairfax).
</p>
<p>
We need ALL parents, students, and community members to come out and make a strong and visible show of support, so the Board of Supervisors, which contributes 70% of the FCPS budget, provides the necessary funding for FCPS. 
</p>
<p>
The rally is co-sponsored by Fairfax FLAGS, #IamFCPS, Save Fairfax Band and Strings (FACE), Fairfax Education Association, and Fairfax County Council of PTAs.
