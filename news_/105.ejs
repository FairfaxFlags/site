        <p><b>Fairfax FLAGS Update: Raise Your Voice and Rally for FCPS Funding!</b></p>
      <p>
        On Jan. 7, FCPS Superintendent Dr. Karen Garza proposed a fully funded (“no cuts”) budget, but the language immersion programs remain at risk because FCPS faces a deficit up to $75 million.
</p><p>
        The School Board is reviewing the proposed budget, and the Board of Supervisors and state legislators are considering how much money to transfer to FCPS.
</p>
      <p><b>Your elected officials need to hear your voice today</b> -- without your support, FCPS may not receive sufficient funding, putting programs like language immersion at risk for elimination.</p>

        <li>
          <b>SEND AN EMAIL TODAY!</b> Click here for form letters and email addresses for the School Board, the Board of Supervisors, and State Legislators. In less than 5 minutes, you can influence your elected officials to fully fund our schools.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ATTEND OUR “INVEST IN KIDS” RALLY ON TUESDAY, FEB. 16!</b> Please join us to advocate for full funding for our schools during an indoor rally on Tuesday, Feb. 16, from 4:45-5:45 pm at the indoor amphitheater of the Fairfax County Government Center (12000 Government Center Pkwy, Fairfax).
      
<p>
        We need all parents, students, and community members to come out and make a strong and visible show of support, so the Board of Supervisors provides the necessary funding for FCPS.
</p><p>
        The Board of Supervisors contributes 70% of the FCPS budget, so their decision on funding will determine the future of our school system and programs like language immersion.
</p><p>

        The rally is sponsored by Fairfax FLAGS, #IamFCPS, Save Fairfax Band and Strings (FACE), Fairfax Education Association, and Fairfax County Council of PTAs.
