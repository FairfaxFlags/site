    <h2>
      Fairfax FLAGS Needs Your Help!
    </h2>
    <p>
      by <a href="mailto:fairfaxflags@gmail.org">Fairfax FLAGS</a>
    </p>

<p>
  We would like to request your urgent help on behalf of Fairfax FLAGS! You attended a Fairfax FLAGS meeting in December and indicated (on the sign-up sheet) your willingness to speak at a public hearing. Tomorrow at 6 AM, registration opens for speaking slots at the January 25 public hearing during which the budget proposed by Dr. Karen Garza, FCPS Superintendent, will be considered. (The hearing begins at 6 PM on January 25.) We need your help, even if you are not available on January 25. 
</p>
<p>
  IF YOU ARE AVAILABLE ON JANUARY 25 at 6 PM:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  We would like to register you as a speaker for Fairfax FLAGS. Could you please send us the following information that is required by FCPS for registration (to allow confirmation of Fairfax County residency): name, address, telephone, and email. In the alternative, you can register yourself at http://www.fcps.edu/schlbd/meetings/requestspeak-online-ph.shtml. Please note that there is a limited number of speaking slots, so if you are unable to do so promptly at 6 AM, the available slots may be taken by other organizations and individuals.
  </li>
  <li>
  We would like to offer our assistance in the preparation of your written statement, which is required and will become part of the public record of the hearing. Each statement is fairly short because remarks are limited to 3 minutes. We will work with you to craft your statement to have the greatest impact on the School Board's consideration of the proposed budget, including the possible elimination of immersion programs. 
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
IF YOU ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON JANUARY 25:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>   
  We still need your help! Someone else can read a statement on your behalf. We also need speakers for future public hearings, including hearings before the Board of Supervisors and state officials, rallies, and media events. We want to work with you now so your story can be told at the January 25 hearing and on future occasions. Please send us your name, address, telephone, and email, and we will contact you to work with you on your statement. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Please tell us who else you recommend to speak! We need speakers to represent a diversity of perspectives, in particular: 
  

  <ul>
    <li>
    Parents from different schools (it is important to have representatives of every School Board member's district).
    </li><li>
    Current elementary school students in FCPS immersion programs.
</li><li>

    Recent alumni of FCPS immersion programs, including middle school, high school, college, and graduate school students.

  </li><li>
  Military and intelligence community personnel who can speak to the importance of multilingualism for their jobs and safeguarding our national security.

        </li><li>

          </li><li>
  Persons from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds who can speak to the importance of language being passed to the next generation.
          </li><li>
  Persons who moved to Fairfax County or a specific school district so their children could participate in immersion programs.

  Education experts and others who can emphasize the value of children learning languages at early ages.
