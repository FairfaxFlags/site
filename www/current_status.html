            In 2009, Fairfax FLAGS and its allies succeeded in saving Fairfax County Public Schools’ (FCPS) World Language Immersion and FLES (now LTC) programs from being eliminated. After this win, the organization became dormant. <b>The battle had been won…or so everyone thought.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter 7 more years of budget cuts. Due to a number of factors, including tougher economic times, FCPS has been forced to cut its budget every year since 2008. 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2017/faq.shtml">Nearly a half-billion dollars has been cut from the schools’ budget since 2008</a>—which means that FCPS is spending $1,000 
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/matthew.dunne.562/videos/577463849073113"> less</a> on each student today than it did in 2009.</p>
      <p>
        Faced with another year of budget cuts, FCPS enlisted help from the community. It set up a Budget Task Force to make recommendations on what the schools could cut next.
        The Task Force solicited help from the wider community, asking the public to use an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2017/budget-tool.shtml">online budget tool</a> to make their own recommendations for cuts.
        In November 2015, the Task Force made its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2017/taskforce/index.shtml">recommendations</a>. <b>Over 75% of the Task Force members chose to cut Language Immersion</b> if FCPS is required to reduce its budget by $50 million. 
        The <a href="file:///C:/FairfaxFLAGS/www/faq.html">LTC</a> program seems safe from cuts at the moment.
      </p>
        <p>
            After the Budget Task Force recommendations were published, Fairfax FLAGS mobilized once again.
            Parents and students wrote emails to Superintendent Garza, urging her to save Language Immersion. Other elected officials were also contacted, 
            with a view of both explaining the importance of early language acquisition and the urgency of fully funding our schools. 
            On January 9, new Fairfax FLAGS leader Matthew Dunne and former FLAGS co-head Amy Fujii <b>spoke in defense of our world language programs</b> at the Virginia state delegate assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
            On January 7, Superintendent Garza released her proposed budget. Instead of making more budget cuts, she presented a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/news/fy2017.shtml">budget with no cuts</a>—and in fact, 
            a modest increase, to be used primarily for increasing employee salaries and reducing elementary class size. 
            In this proposed budget, the Language Immersion program remains in place.
        </p>
        <p>
            But <b>the fight has just begun</b>. Fully funding Superintendent Garza’s budget will take convincing the School Board to approve it and—even more challenging—convincing the 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/government/board">Fairfax County Board of Supervisors</a> to raise its funding to FCPS. 
            Simultaneously, advocates must lobby the state government to allow more of Fairfax County’s state taxes to remain here, to fund our schools. 
            Only 23% of funding for FCPS comes from the state, a significantly lower percentage than that of other Virginia school districts.</p>
        <p>
            The School Board has requested a 6.7 percent increase in the FCPS budget. (Fairfax County provides 70% of the FCPS budget.) 
            County Executive Ed Long has proposed a mere 3 percent increase, which would cause a $68 million budget deficit for FCPS. 
            This is the worst-case scenario that was anticipated by the School Board, and it will require the elimination of immersion programs, if the county follows the the budget task force's recommendations.
        </p><p>
            <b>Fairfax FLAGS is partnering with other advocacy groups</b> to support the fight to fully fund FCPS. If we lose this fight, <b>Language Immersion could be the first academic program on the chopping block</b>. 
            To #saveFCPS and #savelanguageimmersion, join Fairfax FLAGS today. Write or call your <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fcps.edu/schlbd/members/bdmembers.shtml">School Board Board</a>, 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/government/board">Board of Supervisors</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/">Virginia state senators and delegates</a> and tell them that you support fully funding FCPS. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Watch your email and this web site for more opportunities to lend your voice to this important cause. 
            In order to save and expand early foreign language learning in our schools—and in the process, to preserve and improve the high quality of an FCPS education—we all must stand up and be heard.
