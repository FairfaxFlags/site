                                    Fairfax County Public Schools offers two types of partial immersion programs in elementary schools. Under the partial immersion model, students spend half of the day learning in a world language and the other half in English.

                                    First, the World Languages Immersion Program enables students at eight elementary schools to learn a world language (French, German, Japanese, or Spanish) beginning in first grade. Most students participating in this program type are learners (and not native speakers) of the world language. Students learn math, science, and health through the medium of a world language. The curriculum follows the FCPS Program of Studies.

                                    Second, the Two-Way Immersion Program enables students at nine elementary schools to learn a world language (Spanish or Korean) beginning in kindergarten. Approximately half of the students participating in this program type are native speakers of the world language. The program focuses on the development of literacy and content area skills in English and the world language. The students who are native speakers of English learn literacy skills in English and the world language. Through this exposure, they acquire the Spanish or Korean language.  Students who are native speakers of the world language develop English language skills while also developing literacy and content area skills in their home language. The program mutually benefits both student populations as they can serve as peer language role models for each other. The curriculum follows the FCPS Program of Studies.

                                    Fairfax County Public Schools provide a middle school immersion transition program at feeder middle schools for students who successfully complete a FCPS elementary language immersion program.  Specifically, students who begin learning a second language in elementary school may continue their language study in middle and high school. Students successfully completing the 7th Grade Immersion 1 course earn a high school credit. The same is true for students who successfully complete the 8th Grade Immersion 2 course. Immersion students enter high school in 9th Grade at Level 3 of the world language.

                                    The Language through Content (LTC) program replaces the successful Foreign Language in the Elementary School (FLES) program in Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS). There are 54 FCPS schools with LTC programs. Of the 56 schools, 36 schools offer Spanish LTC programs. The remaining schools offer Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Japanese LTC programs.

                                    The LTC program is an approach to language learning that allows students to develop basic communicative skills in a language while reinforcing and enriching concepts from the general program of studies. The LTC program places an emphasis on Science concepts and includes Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) skills. STEAM is based on student driven inquiry and problem solving investigations. Combining such skills with language learning provides a unique way for students to acquire the target foreign language while preparing them with the 21st Century skills needed to become successful global citizens.
                                    FCPS students who participate in an LTC program have the opportunity to continue learning the target foreign language at the middle school and high school levels.

                                    The successful Foreign Language in the Elementary School (FLES) program in Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) was recently replaced with the Language through Content (LTC) program. The FLES program was an approach to language learning that allowed students to develop basic communicative skills in a language while reinforcing and enriching content in other disciplines.

                                    The FLES model provided all students in an elementary school with language learning opportunities. Research studies have indicated that the early study of a second language results in cognitive benefits, gains in academic achievement, and increases in self-esteem, creativity, and positive attitudes toward diversity.

                                    The FCPS FLES model developed students' language proficiency by providing language instruction that supported the concepts taught in the subject areas at the respective grade level. Generally, FLES programs provided 30 minutes of instruction 2-3 times per week, which was continued through middle and high school. The FCPS FLES model was based on the research that shows that students are not only able to learn but are also highly engaged in learning content through the target language. In addition, the culture of the target language was integrated into instruction.
